# Snake Game
A simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

# Introduction
This Snake Game is a classic implementation where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The goal is to eat the food (represented by a black square) to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body. The game utilizes the Turtle graphics library for the graphical interface.

# Getting Started
To run the Snake Game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine and run the Python script snake_game.py. Make sure you have the Turtle graphics library available in your Python environment.

# Game Controls
Up Arrow: Move the snake upwards

Down Arrow: Move the snake downwards

Left Arrow: Move the snake to the left

Right Arrow: Move the snake to the right

# Game Rules
The snake starts with a length of 5 units.

The snake can move in the specified directions using the arrow keys.

The snake grows longer by one unit each time it eats the food.

The game ends if the snake collides with its own body.

The snake can wrap around the screen edges.

# Features
Boundary Wrapping: The snake can wrap around the screen edges, providing a continuous gaming experience.

Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the snake and its own body, triggering a game over when encountered.

Randomized Food Placement: The food appears at random locations on the screen after being consumed by the snake.
# Dependencies
Python 3.x
Turtle graphics library
